		<p class="blog-post-meta">04/10/2015 by <a href="http://twitter.com/animelover1808">Jason Lu</a></p>

		<p>Hey everyone, Jason “animelover1808” Lu here representing the group. Here is our plans for the quarter!</p>

		<h2>Fight Night: Casual Edition renamed to Salty Saturdays</h2>
		<p>To prevent confusion between Fight Night: Ranked Edition and Fight Night: Casual Edition, we’re now renaming our casual nights to Salty Saturdays. Our ranked nights will now simply known as Fight Night. Phew, now we don’t need to type as much when writing the event names down! :)

		  <h2>Mystery Game Tournament</h2>
		<p>After the beta test run while we were still underground, I am proud to announce the Mystery Game Tournament is coming back even better set for week one! First off the prizes have been improved!</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>1st place gets an awesome Top Ramen style shirt!</li>
		  <li>2nd place gets a box of Street Fighter Dhalsim Curry.</li>
		  <li>3rd gets a can of Salt and Vinegar Pringles.</li>
		</ul> 
		<p>Basic rules are ⅔ for the tournament until grand finals which is ⅗ (except Puzzle Fighter). Every matchup will be a different randomly drawn out fighting game, which has been upgraded to 3 different consoles (360, PS3, and Wii). This will occur on the first week back in our “OG” room, Baskin Engineering 330.</p>

		<h2>Fight Night Ranked Season for Super Smash Bros. for Wii U (Smash 4)</h2>
		<p>After the amazing turnout for our two test run tournaments, we are pleased to announce that Fight Night for Smash 4 will continue onto Spring quarter. We are now attempting to adapt the Evolution Championship rules for Smash 4. However because of the difficulties with setup, we expect hiccups to occur as we adjust to this drastic change.</p>

		<h2>Marvel Kumite</h2>
		<p>Now that the Street Fighter 4 Fight Night season has ended we have more flexibility in doing other stuff. One thing that was attempted and will be so once more is the Marvel Kumite aka the round robin. I will attempt it once more with a slight change in format. Rather than it being it’s own series, I’m just gonna pay out to the top 3 at the end of the event.</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>1st gets $20.</li>
		  <li>2nd gets $5.</li>
		  <li>3rd gets $1.</li>
		</ul>
<p>This is a callback to the original roots of the Santa Cruz Fighting Game Community. Hope to see you all there and good luck to everyone!</p>

		<h2>GDA Collab X SCFGC Fundraiser Smash 4 Tournament</h2>
		<p>We're partnering with the <a href="https://facebook.com/groups/gdacollab/">GDA Collaboration</a> to run a Smash 4 tournament to help raise funds for both organizations! The entry fee will be $5 and the top 3 will get a % payout. The rest will go to the GDA Collaboration and Santa Cruz Fighting Game Community to help fund organization activities.</p>
<p>The projected date is on <strong>April 16 (Thursday) night at Baskin Engineering 2 192 or 194, but this still has a chance of changing</strong>. We will update you all when the date and location is finalized.</p>

		<h2>Slugfest: The Big Tournament of the Year!</h2>
		<p>So after much planning and still planning, we are going to do a huge tournament. At the moment the planned games are still tentative, but we will update you as soon as we get a final list.</p>

		<p>Unlike Fight Night, this tournament will have a venue fee for all non-UCSC entrants and will require a student ID for free entry. Non-UCSC entrants can still get in for free if they bring a full setup (TV, console, and game) to be used in tournament.</p>

		<p>Part of the venue fee will go towards recuperating some of the expenses we have already spent for the organization. The rest will go towards a permanent stream setup and projector for the organization. The pot fee will of course will be paid out to either top 3 or 8 which is TBD. More information on the event (date, price, etc.) will come out soon!</p>

		<h2>Fight Night Lab Time</h2>
		<p>At Fight Night we will open a setup exclusively for training mode between players. I specifically will be attempting to teach Marvel to those that wish to learn. This will run alongside the setups used for tournament.</p>

		<h2>Doubles for Smash</h2>
		<p>We have been asked numerous times about running doubles for some of our Smash games. Before due to logistics with the Fight Night series for both games it was impossible. Now that the Fight Night season has finished for most of our games, we are going to try and move forward with running doubles.</p>

<h2>Open Schedule for Traditional Fighting Games!</h2>
<p>Towards the last half of the quarter we have the freedom to really try a lot of different ideas. A few ideas are Edition Select and Omega Mode tournaments if people want to do that. We could also do Doubles where we could have our partner coach us which could be fun and helpful in getting better. I would like to do a Street Fighter x Tekken scramble mode tournament if people are down for that too. I would prefer to do other stuff than all of us just playing casuals since that can be done on Salty Saturdays, but I am not opposed to playing just casuals. If anyone has suggestions please message me on Facebook or discuss about it in the group.</p>
